This game/test helps you to know for sure.\n        The rules are easy: Color spectrum is divided into squares, which are mixed between each other. You should move the squares and put the spectrum into its initial state. Border squares are already in their right positions and you cannot move them. Moreover, you can move the squares only on lines where they are situated. Upon completing you can see your mistakes and your highscore, based on mistakes number, movements number and time.\n        In Game Center you can compare your highscore with highscores of people all over the world. Good luck :)";
